# Misc. small tricks - Part 01
### You can sometimes run Wscript content
**What's that?**

In other words, you can run *desktop* VBScript (*.vbs) and JScript (*.js; not JavaScript) files via a native Windows feature. Make use of this! You can even enter usually forbidden areas via the FileSystemObject handler, and even modify some areas.

### PCs have networking ports open - you just need to start them yourself!
Usually, work or school device shave networking TCP ports open, which means you can get them to communicate via a custom app. **Very** useful for exploitation; I used this exploit for an encrypted chat app of my own design (avoids prying eyes).
