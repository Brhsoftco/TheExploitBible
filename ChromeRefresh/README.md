# Getting around Chrome ‘clear history’ blocks

Some organisations really like control over their computing
resources…sometimes a little too much. When you get employed, or you
enroll at any school, it’s likely that the IT department has employed
some form of monitoring system to ensure ‘good digital habits’;
unfortunately, these systems tend to be more authoritarian than helpful.

Commonly, organisations will use Google’s GSuite platform to collaborate
and manage resources, which is, by the way, a great method of management
– but it is flawed. When you open Google Chrome on some company-owned
devices, you might run into a little label that says ‘managed by your
organisation’. If you see this, that means the IT department can and
will look at your data (including internet history). Hence, if you try
and clear it, it’ll be disabled in settings.

**So, how do we exploit this and clear our history?**

Well, it’s actually really simple – and it works for *all*
Chromium-based browsers.

Essentially, Chromium browsers store data in a series of SQLite
databases. These files contain a wealth of digital information like your
browsing history, tracking data, cookies, and of course, other vital
components of the ecosystem like user information.

What’s to stop you from clearing this information manually? Nothing! We
don’t need built-in menus to get rid of unneeded data. There’s a folder
that contains everything, and we can remove it one shot.

**How to do it**

*Before doing any of this, ensure Chrome.exe is dead and isn’t running
in any capacity. Also note that `chromeRefresh.vbs` will attempt to forcefully kill Chrome.*

1.  You can get to CMD (Command Prompt)

    1.  `cd /d “%LOCALAPPDATA%\Google\Chrome\User Data”`

    2.  `del “Default”`

    3.  `Are you sure? (Y/N) y`

2.  You can’t get to CMD

    1.  Download `chromeRefresh.vbs`

    2.  Run `chromeRefresh.vbs`

**Conclusion**

Thinking outside of the box will get you far in pentesting; just because
the menu won’t permit something, doesn’t mean a little snooping won’t
work.
